# Big O

- Is a **practice for time optimization** including **memory optimization** of coding
- Applied **data structure** and **algorithm deep learning** is its great asset in solving problems
- This is highly **important**

> **Pro Tip:** In example of two codes such as Code 1 and Code 2, Code 1 uses brute forcing using 2 for loops coinsiding each other
> such thing would highly depend on a large scale of data resulting in **O^n**, whilst Code 2 uses proper usage of data structure that could
> be solved in **O(n)**
