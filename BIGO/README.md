# Big O

- Is a **practice for time optimization** including **memory optimization** of coding
- Applied **data structure** and **algorithm deep learning** is its great asset in solving problems
- This is highly **important**

> **Pro Tip:** In example of two codes such as Code 1 and Code 2, Code 1 uses brute forcing using 2 for loops coinsiding each other
> such thing would highly depend on a large scale of data resulting in **O^n**, whilst Code 2 uses proper usage of data structure that could
> be solved in **O(n)**

# Time Complexity

- We **measure time complexity using number of operation** not through **time alone**
- We consider **slow computers** and **fast computers** for coding a solution
- A small **microseconds** would highly impact in a large set of **data**

# Space/Time Complexity

- This is the amount of memory that the code uses
  > **Elaboration:** For example **Code 1** runs for a short amount of time(seconds) but uses a lot of memory,
  > hence **Code 2** runs much slower but uses low amount of memory. This should be considered hand in hand also.
