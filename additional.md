Javascript Algorithms by Codevolution

Course is seperated both data structures and algorithms

# Algorithm

- Algorithm
- Measuring performance
- Time and Space Complexity
- Big O notation
- Sort
- Search
- Misc. algorithms and problem solving

## Author's Take
It seem hard and that is because it is hard
Have a pen and paper and trace the execution code with sample input
Code along with the author and do not rush through the video

# What is an algorithm?

- An algorithm is a set of ***well-defined*** instructions to ***solve*** a particular problem

### Characteristics of algorithm
- Well defined inputs and outputs
- Each step should be clear and unambiguous
- Language independent

### Why algorithms?

As a developer, you're going to come across problems that you need to resolve. Learning algorithms translates to learning different techniques to efficiently solve those problems.

One problem can be solved in many ways using different algorithms. Every algorithm comes with its own tradeoffs when it comes to performance.
